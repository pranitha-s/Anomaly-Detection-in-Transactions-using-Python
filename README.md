# Anomaly-Detection-in-Transactions-using-Python
Anomaly detection in transactions means identifying unusual or unexpected patterns within transactions or related activities. These patterns, known as anomalies or outliers, deviate significantly from the expected norm and could indicate irregular or fraudulent behaviour.

## Overview

Anomaly Detection in Transactions allows us to:

- Identify unusual patterns or outliers within transaction data.
- Detect potentially irregular or fraudulent behavior.
- Ensure the accuracy and security of financial transactions.

## Implementation

We perform Anomaly Detection in Transactions using Python in several key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Import the necessary Python libraries and load the transaction dataset.

2. **Data Exploration**: Examine the dataset for missing values and column insights.

3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of transaction amounts, transaction amounts by account type, average transaction amounts by age, count of transactions by day of the week, and the correlation between columns.

4. **Anomaly Detection**: We implement anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **User Input Prediction**: Use the trained model to detect anomalies in user input.

## Results

Anomaly Detection in Transactions provides a powerful tool for identifying unusual patterns within transaction data, helping to maintain the integrity and security of financial and online operations.
